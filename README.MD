A relatively light addon that adds an extra DropDown option to the Encounter Journal, to pick Season 4 as your "Expansion". You can then see the 5 dungeons from Season 4 in one place!

Does not change existing code from Blizzard, so expect some oddities from the DropDownMenu like two options selected. The background will stay as the last expansion you selected. Etc.
